## AI Systems Advisor | LLM & Agentic AI

I design and evaluate production-grade LLM and agentic AI systems with a focus on reliability, cost efficiency, and real-world deployment.

My work centers on taking AI agents beyond demos—reducing failure modes, controlling inference costs, and implementing governance and evaluation frameworks that make AI systems dependable at scale.

### What I Work On
- Agentic AI system design and orchestration
- LLM evaluation, monitoring, and failure analysis
- Cost-optimized inference and deployment
- Governance patterns for real-world AI systems

### Who I Help
- Startups scaling LLMs beyond demos into production
- Enterprises deploying AI agents in finance, ops, and compliance
- Founders needing AI architecture reviews before large spend

### Featured Work
- Agentic AI frameworks with tool-use and memory
- LLM evaluation pipelines for reliability and bias
- Cost-optimized inference and orchestration patterns

### Advisory Focus
I work at the intersection of AI architecture, evaluation, and operations—helping teams deploy LLM and agentic systems that are dependable, cost-aware, and ready for production.
