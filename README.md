### AI Systems Advisor | LLM & Agentic Architecture ###
I bridge the gap between "impressive demos" and production-grade reliability.

Most AI initiatives fail because they treat LLMs as traditional software. I help engineering leaders move away from manual "vibe-checking" toward systematic, data-driven reliability for their agentic workflows. My work is focused on reducing the operational risk and technical debt that accumulate when AI is shipped without rigorous evaluation and governance.

## My Advisory Focus ##
I provide independent technical judgment at the system level. I don't just "implement"—I ensure your architecture is deterministic, secure, and cost-optimized before it hits production.

- Production Readiness Audits: Identifying reliability, evaluation, and governance gaps in your current LLM stack.

- Agentic Governance: Defining hard execution boundaries to prevent hallucinated permissions and runaway loops.

- Systematic Evaluation: Moving beyond basic prompts to robust regression testing and drift monitoring.

- Cost & Latency Optimization: Analysis of tool usage and failure modes to improve predictability and ROI.

## Who I Work With ##
- Founders & CTOs scaling LLM systems beyond the initial prototype phase.

- Engineering Leaders responsible for the reliability and security of autonomous agents.

- Enterprise Teams operating under strict cost, compliance, or audit constraints.

## Featured Work ##
- Enterprise AI Operations Agent: Framework for managing production LLM lifecycles.

- LLM-Eval-Reliability-Platform: Infrastructure for regression evals, drift detection, and cost tracking.

- Engagement is advisory-only. I provide the blueprint and the guardrails; your team maintains the implementation ownership.
