# Principal AI Systems Architect | Strategic Advisor (MBA)

**I bridge the gap between "impressive demos" and production-grade reliability.**

Most Enterprise AI initiatives stall because they treat Agents as standard software. I help engineering leaders move from manual "vibe-checking" to **deterministic, governed, and audit-ready architectures**.

My focus is **Zero-Trust GenAI**: Reducing operational risk and technical debt by strictly defining *how* LLMs access your data and spending.

## 🛠️ Technical Arsenal
**Core Stack:** `Python 3.12+` `FastMCP` `LangGraph` `Pydantic V2` `PostgreSQL` `Docker`
**Reliability:** `Arize Phoenix` `Prometheus` `PyTest` `GitHub Actions`
**Standards:** `Model Context Protocol (MCP)` `OpenAI API` `Anthropic`

## 🏛️ Featured Architecture
**[The Enterprise Agentic Suite](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/enterprise-agentic-suite)**
A production-grade ecosystem for deploying autonomous agents in high-compliance environments (Banking, Healthcare).

* **[Enterprise Context Mesh](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/enterprise-context-mesh):** The "Data Layer." A Zero-Trust MCP Hub connecting LLMs to legacy SQL/SAP silos via read-only adapters.
* **[AI Ops Agent](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-ops-agent):** The "Control Layer." Orchestrates model routing, budget enforcement, and Human-in-the-Loop authorization.
* **[Eval Reliability Platform](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/eval-reliability-platform):** The "Audit Layer." Continuous regression testing for hallucination rates and intent drift.

## 💼 Advisory & Implementation Focus
I provide independent technical judgment at the system level. I don't just "implement"—I ensure your architecture is **deterministic, secure, and cost-optimized** before it hits production.

* **Production Readiness Audits:** Identifying reliability, evaluation, and governance gaps in your current LLM stack.
* **Agentic Governance:** Defining hard execution boundaries (permissions, budget caps) to prevent runaway loops.
* **Systematic Evaluation:** Moving beyond basic prompts to robust regression testing and drift monitoring.
* **Cost & Latency Optimization:** Analysis of tool usage and failure modes to improve predictability and ROI.

## 🤝 Engagement Model
**"Strategic Core & Hand-off"**
I architect and build the critical infrastructure (The Mesh, The Governance Logic, The Eval Harness), then train your internal team for long-term maintenance.
* **Ideal for:** CTOs scaling beyond the prototype phase who need "Day 1" reliability.
