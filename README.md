# AI Systems Advisor | LLM & Agentic AI  
### Turning production AI into operating leverage, not experiments

I design, evaluate, and deploy production-grade AI systems that replace manual work, reduce operational risk, and enable companies to scale without linear headcount growth.

My work focuses on taking LLM and agentic systems beyond demos — enforcing reliability, cost control, and governance so AI can be trusted in real business workflows.


### What I Work On
- Agentic AI system design and orchestration
- LLM evaluation, monitoring, and failure analysis
- Cost-optimized inference and deployment
- Governance patterns for real-world AI systems

## Who I Help

- Founders scaling AI beyond prototypes into production  
- SaaS and software teams deploying AI in revenue or ops workflows  
- Enterprises operating AI agents under cost, risk, or compliance constraints  


## Featured Work

- Production AI systems for sales, operations, and internal decision support  
- LLM evaluation and reliability platforms for drift, regression, and cost control  
- Cost-optimized inference and orchestration patterns  


### Advisory Focus
I work at the intersection of AI architecture, evaluation, and operations—helping teams deploy LLM and agentic systems that are dependable, cost-aware, and ready for production.

This work is advisory-first and focused on outcomes, not tool selection or experimentation.

## Advisory Engagements

I work with teams through focused advisory engagements, including:

- AI system architecture and production readiness audits  
- LLM evaluation, reliability, and cost risk assessments  
- Agentic AI design reviews for real-world deployment  

Engagements are scoped around business impact and production constraints, not hours or tooling.
